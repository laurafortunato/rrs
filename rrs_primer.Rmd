## Abstract

The rights retention strategy (RRS) is a recently-developed tool
developed in the ongoing debate in scholarly communications.  Tools
like this may seem obscure and of little relevance to academics
publishing papers, but I believe it is important that academics learn
about these tools, and what they are trying to achieve.  This primer
is written to give academics an overview of the RRS and its pros and
cons in scholarly communciation.  My view is that overall the RRS
should be seen as part of the toolkit to overbcome being "Bullied into
Bad Science".


**Abbreviations: ** 
AAM: author accepted manuscript
RRS: rights retention strategy; 
VOR: version of record.


# Introduction

**This is written by researchers, for researchers, very much
work-in-progress during 2021.**.

Congratulations!  Your paper has just been accepted for publication in
a journal.  Your excitement may soon fade however when it turns to the
thorny issue of complying with open access policies.  If you are
lucky, your funders may readily pay the article processing charge
(APC).  Or you may have chosen a diamond OA venue where there is no
APC.  But what about if you have chosen to publish in a 'hybrid' venue
and you would like to make your article open access with no recourse
to funds for paying the APC?  (If you have chosen a journal that is
APC-OA, i.e. you pay to publish in it, but not to read it, this
article can't help you.)

One thing you might wish to do is to share the version of the
manuscript that the journal has been accepted, the so-called
"author-accepted manuscript".  This version is *your* manuscript,
taking on board comments during the review process (editors and
reviewers, who are typically your colleagues).  But many journals
demand that you should not share your own AAM until an embargo period
(often 6-24 months) has passed.  Publishers have imposed these embargo
periods as a way to protect their business model [ref needed].  Given
that your paper may take many months post acceptance to appear in
print, being able to share your AAM immediately allows people
immediate access to your research.

Once a journal has finished turning your manuscript into the final
article by suitable typesetting and reformatting, the 'version of
record' (VOR) is born. Hence your paper is usually at least two
papers: the AAM and the VOR.  Sharing AAMs provides an equitable
approach to open access for your research, as no APC is required.
Furthermore, if your VOR gets locked behind a paywall, the AAM can be
made freely available *the same day* that the editor tells you your
work will be accepted by the journal?


So, how can you legally share your AAM immediately upon publication?
There are several approaches to this [refs], of which the latest is
the "Rights Retention Strategy" (RRS), developed by Coalition S.  In
this primer, I describe what the RRS is and its pros and cons.  I have
written this because current advice seems conditioned on the principle
that your work has been supported by a funder that is part of
Coalition S.  However the RRS statement is a tool that ALL authors can
use, irrespective of funding.


## What is the RRS?


First, what is it?  It is the following piece of text that you add
prominently to your manuscript before submitting it to a journal.

    For the purpose of Open Access, the author has applied a CC BY
	public copyright licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript (AAM)
	version arising from this submission


This magic sentence alerts the editor at the start of the submission
process of your intention to share your AAM under a CC BY licence (a
permissive licence ...).  This *should* give you the right to freely
share your AAM.

It might seem pragmatic to routinely adopt this text in our
manuscripts.  Even if you plan to send the journal to a publisher that
does not ask you to sign away your rights, it sets a good example to
others in the community.

## Examples of it in action...

(Ross has some examples)


## What are the advantages for an author?

If the RRS statement, it offers a way to publish in hybrid journals
without paying an APC.  It signals to the publishing community that
authors are keen to keep their copyright.  Much is made by publishers
of the "hallowed status" of the VOR. e.g. it is referred to as "the
foundation of the scientific record" (IOP letter). However, this seems
like an outdated idea -- research is not a single PDF.  By contrast,
papers can evolve over time (and DOIs can now be suitably versioned):


"However, VOR did not appear on the eighth day of Creation; it really
is the spin-off of a particular technology, print." Jean-Claude
Gu√©don, in response to post <https://oaspa.org/open-post-the-rise-of-immediate-green-oa-undermines-progress/>


In other areas, e.g. computing, we have embraced the notion of version
control, and versioning, to allow us to refer to software at different
points in time, rather than a single thing.  Why restrict papers to a
single published version?  As long as researchers are explicit about
which version of a paper they are citing, there is no problem (ideally
if the object being cited is freely available).  This idea is
gradually being adopted in scholarly communications, e.g. moving away
from "version of record" to "record of versions" (a term coined by
Bianca Kramer), which seems a much richer idea.


![Typical life cycle of a manuscript.  Time goes from left-to-right in
this diagram.  Authors (bottom) send their first paper (V1) to the
editor (top) and receive reviews in return.  After two rounds of
revisions, the editor deems the paper acceptable ("OK").  When the
paper is accepted, the latest version (3) automatically becomes the
author-accepted manuscript (AAM) which can be freely shared.  Some
time later, the publisher updates V3 to produce the version of record
(VOR).](ms_changes-crop.pdf)

## What are the disadvantages?

It is simply too early to tell if this RRS provides to have any real
bite in revolutionising scholarly communication. 

The journal *Science* is currently trialling a pilot program where it
will allow plan-S funded researchers to use RRS. It will not currently
allow other researchers to use the RRS to share their AAMs without
embargo (M Phelan, personal
communication). <https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/aaft-foa011421.php>
The only publishers that seem to endorese the RRS are the *Royal Society* and the *Microbiology society*
<https://www.coalition-s.org/rights-retention-strategy>.

Several concerns have been raised already:

1. Your paper might be desk-rejected, i.e. rejected by  editorial team
   rather than going out for peer review.

2. You might have your paper accepted in principle, only to find that
the publisher demands some embargo on publication of the AAM as a
condition of publishing the paper [cite tweet].

3. You might be asked to pay an APC up-front before the paper is sent
   out to review.
   
4. The editorial team might redirect your article from one journal to
   a different journal that requires an APC.


It can be assumed that problems 3 and 4 have already occurred given
the publication of guidance from Wellcome in March 2021 <https://wellcome.org/press-release/publishing-hybrid-open-access-journals>.

Many traditional publishers have signed a letter objecting to the RRS:
<https://ioppublishing.org/signatories_publish_statement_on_rights_retention_strategy/>

Their fundamental objection seems to me that they are the only
trusted guardians of the publishing record, and that they need to
protect their business.

So although you should be able to use the RRS to freely share your
AAM, you may meet resistance from publishers, and journals may refuse
to publish your work.  If this happens, I am truly sorry, but your
only recourse would be to inform the community and hope that
visibility of their actions will cause publishers to remove their
objections.  Those funded by coalition S funders should also inform
their funders.  **I would also suggest involving COPE [MATT?].**

## Related Approaches

This idea of preserving author rights during publication is not new;
several other routes are available, or have been tried.  UK SCL; MIT
rights; Sparc addendum.  Legislation has also been used , e.g. France,
Belgium, to allow researchers to share their own work.  What does seem
to be new with the RRS is that the publisher is alerted at the time of
initial submission about the intention to use the RRS.


## Will it help us?  will it disappear?

Scholarly communications seems like an epic game of chess played out
over decades.  Just as we (academics) think there is some solution,
e.g. the UK Finch report, publishers respond with moves that were
unintended (e.g. witness the rise of hybrid publications, and
escalating APCs).  I doubt the RRS is the silver bullet, but if
nothing else it is a useful tool to raise awareness of scholarly
communication.  Even if you are a well-funded researcher that can
afford high APCs, this system excludes those researchers, particularly
from other countries (the global South, ref?) that cannot afford such
fees.

It may be that the RRS is a tool that may disappear after a few years,
if publishers accept that authors hold the rights to their AAM.  In
this sense, the RRS would have been a success, even if no longer
required, as it brought about the necessary change.  However,
experience has shown us that publishers are capable of responding to
strong moves with equally strong moves, and what "unintended
consequences" there may be of adopting RRS.  However, given how messed
up scholarly communications appears both inside and outside of the
academic bubble, I doubt it will make matters worse for us as
academics.

In a nutshell, if traditional publishers see the RRS as a threat to
their continued existence, then this at least promotes discussion.  I
would rather see more equitable OA practices, such as
overlay and diamond OA journals.
